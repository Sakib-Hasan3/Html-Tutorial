# HTML Tutorial
This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is the standard language for creating web pages.

1. Basic HTML Structure
Every HTML document has a basic structure. Hereâ€™s an example of the skeleton for an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>

2. HTML Elements
Headings: Use <h1> to <h6> tags for headings. <h1> is the largest, and <h6> is the smallest.


<h1>This is a main heading</h1>
<h2>This is a subheading</h2>

Paragraphs: Use the <p> tag to create paragraphs of text.

<p>This is a paragraph of text in HTML.</p>

Links: Use the <a> tag to create hyperlinks.

<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>

Images: Use the <img> tag to display images.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of Image">

3. HTML Lists
Ordered List: Uses <ol> for an ordered list (numbered).

<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ol>

Unordered List: Uses <ul> for an unordered list (bulleted).

<ul>
  <li>Item one</li>
  <li>Item two</li>
</ul>

4. Forms
Forms are used to collect user input. Example:

<form action="/submit" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

5. HTML Tables
HTML tables allow you to organize data in rows and columns.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alice</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bob</td>
    <td>25</td>
  </tr>
</table>

6. Environment Setup
To start working with HTML, you only need a text editor and a web browser. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

Text Editor: Choose a text editor to write your HTML code. Some popular options are:

Visual Studio Code
Sublime Text
Notepad++
Atom
Web Browser: HTML files are viewed in a web browser. You can use any modern browser, such as:

Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Microsoft Edge
Create an HTML File: After installing a text editor, create a new file with the .html extension. For example, index.html.

Open Your HTML File: After saving your HTML file, open it using any browser to view the rendered page.
